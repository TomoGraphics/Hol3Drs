# OpenSCAD models

Models I made in [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/).
Mostly sample holder for our [uCT scanners](http://bruker-microct.com/products/all_products.htm) (1172 and 1272).
The .scad-Files in this folder are the *originals*, the [STL](STL) folder contains the exported [STL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)) files which are then printed on our [Form 2](http://formlabs.com/products/3d-printers/form-2/) 3D printer.
